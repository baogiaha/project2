    <h2>How does Web application work?</h2>
    <p>Web applicatins are usually coded in browser-supported language such as JavaScript and HTML as these langues rely on the browser to render the program executable.</p>
    
    <h3>Here is what a typical web applilcation flow looks like:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>User triggers a request to the web server over the Internet.</li>    
        <li>Web server forwards this request to the appropriate web application server.</li>
        <li>Web application server performs the request task.</li>
        <li>Web application server sends results to the web serer witht he requested information or processed data.</li>
        <li>Web server responds back to the client with the request information that then appears on the user's display.</li>
    </ul>
